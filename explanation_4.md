Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the sort_012 function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the algorithm only traverses the array once, and at each step, it performs constant-time operations such as comparisons and swaps.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the sort_012 function is O(1), meaning it uses constant extra space regardless of the size of the input array. This is because the algorithm performs all operations in place, without requiring any additional data structures that grow with the input size.
