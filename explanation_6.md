The time complexity of the get_min_max algorithm is O(n), indicating linear time complexity. It efficiently finds both the minimum and maximum values in a list of integers with a single traversal.
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), indicating constant space complexity. It uses only a fixed amount of additional memory regardless of the size of the input list.
